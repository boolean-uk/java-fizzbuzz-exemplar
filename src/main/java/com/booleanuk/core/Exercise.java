    // Since an array can only contain values of a single type, we're providing an array of strings for you to run logic on.
    // You'll need to convert each string into a number to solve this exercise
    // For example, the tests will provide an input such as ["1", "2", "10", "15"] and will expect an output of ["1", "2", "Buzz", "Fizzbuzz"]
    // Notice the "throws NumberFormatException" on the method signature.
    // As you will need to convert a String to an Int, there is a chance an error could happen.
    // If, for example, the provided input looked like ["1", "2", "apple", "15"], we would get an error trying to convert "apple" into an integer
    // The "throws NumberFormatException" tells the computer that this method could potentially error
